Game Deal Tracker - The application allows the user to peruse a list of games that are on sale, tracked across 30 different stores like Steam, Humble Store, and Gamesplanet. When clicking on a specific listing, the user will be presented with a list of all of the different deals tied to that game. When a user clicks on a specific deal, it will re-route them to that store's site. This data is pulled from the [CheapShark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/). Features of the site include loading more deals when a user clicks the next page button, filtering deals by different criteria, searching for specific games, and responsive design.
